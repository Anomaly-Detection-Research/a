### ARIMA defferancing poceudre
- deferancing 1 : take Ynew = Yt - Yt-1
- deferancing 2 : take Yd2 = Ynewt - Ynewt-1

#### Trend (Lag-1) defferencing
- Lag-1 means difeancing opeartion is Yt - Yt-1
- remove trend
- denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q)
- Order d = {0,1,2,..}
  - d=0 means no deferancing(no trend)
  - d=1 means perform deferancing once (linear trend)
  - d=2 means double-defenacing
#### Seasonal (Lag-M) defferencing
- Lag-M means differancing operation is Yt - Yt-M
- remove seasonal trends
- for cycle with M seasons use Lag-M
- denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)
- Order D = {0=none, 1=once}
  - D=0 means do not perform seasonal differancing
  - D=1 means perform seasonal differancing ONCE
