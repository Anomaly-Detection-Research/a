### Skimmed [A Survey on Social Media Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01102) because of the interest in the field

- Group anomaly is usually more subtle than individual anomaly. At the individual level, the activities might appear to be normal
- As in most cases, it is very difficult to obtain the ground truth labels for the anomalies.
- many of the existing methods deal with memory-resident graphs, while real life social networks are often too large to fit into the memory.

#### Pont Anomaly Detection
- Activity based
- Graph based
