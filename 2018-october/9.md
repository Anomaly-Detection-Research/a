### White noice 
- mean = 0
- variance  constant
- uncorrelated 
- Cannot be used for forecasting
- Take average A

### Auto regressive(AR) models
- Yt depends only on past Yt-1 .. Yt-n
- Yt=f(Ytpast)
- AR(p) model Yt=f(Yt-1 to Yt-p)

### Moving average(MA) model
- Yt depeds on past value errors et-1
    - Yt-1 = B1Yt-2 + B0 + et-1
    - Yt-2 = B1Yt-3 + B0 + et-2
- Yt = f(et, et-1, .., et-n)
- et is assumed to be white noice with
    - mean = 0
    - variance is constant
- MA(q) model Yt = f(et, .., et-q)
### ARMA Model
- Use past values and also the error term
- Yt = f(Ytpast, ets)
- ARMA(p,q) model Yt = f(Yt-1 .. Yt-p, et-1 .. et-q)


### Stationarity of a Time Series
- Stickly stationary 
    - Marginal distribution of Y at time t[p(Yt)] is same as at any other point
    - Mean and Variance are time invarient
        - Mean and Variaence same for same interval in different periods
- Weakly stationary
    - 
- for AR, MA, ARMA time seriers has to be stationary(future is similar to past)
- if time series is not stationary we make it stationary by diferantiating the  time series
    - once deferantiated time series is called integrated of order d, denoted by I(d)
    - series, which is stationary without diferantiating, is said to be I(o)
